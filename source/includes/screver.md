# Screver

Screver is a survey platform for building, distributing, and analyzing customer feedback flows.

This documentation is split into two parts:

- Public runtime API (`/api/v1`) for custom clients (web/mobile/embed) that render and submit surveys.
- Bearer-protected API (`/api/v2`) for management, configuration, and integrations.

Recommended reading order:

1. Public API (Custom Client)
2. Authentication (Bearer Token)
3. Other Bearer-protected sections (`Surveys`, `Survey Items`, `Survey Results`, etc.)
